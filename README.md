## Getting Started 🚀 🚀 🚀

- [You can see here](https://62a1558bf83a460889bba0eb--pokedexapireact.netlify.app/)

Hello, my name is Julian and this is my test of PokeAPI with React. If you wanna run the code, please install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

And then, run this please:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or (with docker)
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the test.

## Implemented Technologies

Please, let me show you all of tools that i used, to build this test:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
- And another more tools 😎 .

You can check the rest on package.json file!

## Development Vision

When I develop this code, I try to maintain the atomic component design paradigm, making (where possible) for each element of the sections a specific functional component. Given the number of elements built. It should be noted that the greatest workload was not found in the user interface styles, but at a logical level, in the connections with the different APIs to obtain the ETH account data.

Thank you very much for all the time and dedication, blessings! 🙏
